🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to uncover meaningful business insights.
The goal is to demonstrate practical SQL skills used by data analysts to answer real-world business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

This project is designed as a portfolio project for Data Analyst roles.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional retail sales data with information such as:

Column	

Transaction ID - Unique identifier for each transaction

Order Date -	Date of purchase

Product -	Product name or category

Quantity -	Number of units sold

Sale -s	Total sales value

Customer ID -	Unique customer identifier

Gender -	Customer gender

Age -	Customer age


Region -	Sales region

Shift -	Time of purchase (Morning / Evening)

The dataset is stored in CSV format and analyzed using SQL queries.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)

Relational Database

Git & GitHub

🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis aims to answer the following business-driven questions:

What is the overall sales performance?

Which products and categories generate the highest revenue?

Who are the top-spending customers?

How do sales vary by region and time (shift)?

What are the customer purchasing patterns?

These objectives reflect real analytics tasks commonly performed in retail and consulting environments.

🧠 SQL Concepts & Skills Used

This project demonstrates strong command over core SQL concepts, including:

Data filtering using WHERE

Aggregations using SUM, COUNT, AVG

Grouped analysis using GROUP BY and HAVING

Sorting results using ORDER BY


Conditional logic using CASE WHEN

Date-based analysis

Business-oriented query writing

📊 Key Insights

(Insights may vary based on query execution)

Certain product categories contribute significantly to total sales.
